title: "Project Euler Problem 6: Sum of Square Difference"
---

Let's solve problem six in Project Euler in a programming language of your choice. Yes, that's correct, you can choose!

### Spoiler alert

If you have an academic interest in Project Euler, and you have not solved problem six, I suggest you do so before reading this post lest you deprive yourself of an opportunity to learn.

## The problem

This is one of the easiest Project Euler problems.

> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Up to $$n = 100$$ it is trivial, but we can use [math][1] to solve it up to massive numbers, like [a thousand quinquagintaquadringentillion][2] (that's $$10^{2703}$$, or 1 followed by 2703 zeros), that could otherwise take years to solve even for a computer.

## Linear solution

Sometimes the most obvious solution isn't necessarily the best one.

$$
(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100)^2 + (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + 100^2)
$$

This was my first try in Ruby.

{% highlight ruby %}
(1..100).reduce(:+)**2 - (1..100).map { |n| n**2 }.reduce(:+)
{% endhighlight %}

For small numbers, this works well. But what if, instead of 100, you had to solve for a thousand quinquagintaquadringentillion? No one wants to create arrays with that many elements or loops with that many iterations.

## A better solution

With the help of elementary math--specifically, mathematical induction--we can solve this problem up to any number.

This is the square of the sum up to $$n$$.

$$
(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n)^2 = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
$$

And the sum of squares up to $$n$$.

$$
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
$$

And the solution up to $$n$$.

$$
\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
$$

Using these formulas, we can solve this problem up to nonsensical numbers in microseconds. Here's the solution in Ruby; it's not terribly interesting.

{% highlight ruby %}
(n * (n + 1) / 2)**2 - (n * (n + 1)) * ((n * 2) + 1) / 6
{% endhighlight %}

I was curious, so I created [benchmarks][3] to illustrate the efficiency of four different techniques: Using map and reduce, enumerators, while loop, and induction. I tested the earlier three against $$n = 10^6$$, and the latter against a thousand quinquagintaquadringentillion, or $$10^{2703}$$.

{% highlight ruby %}
def map_reduce(n)
  (1..n).reduce(:+)**2 - (1..n).map { |n| n**2 }.reduce(:+)
end

def enum(n)
  sum_of_squares = square_of_sum = 0
  n.downto 1 do |i|
    square_of_sum += i; sum_of_squares += i * i
  end
  square_of_sum**2 - sum_of_squares
end

def while_loop(n)
  sum_of_squares = square_of_sum = 0
  while n > 0
    square_of_sum += n; sum_of_squares += n * n; n -= 1
  end
  square_of_sum**2 - sum_of_squares
end
{% endhighlight %}

It's hardly surprising, but map/reduce, enumerator, and `while` loop took 2.9, 1.6, and 1.2 seconds respectively. I imagine `while` is faster because it deals only with primitive types and no data structures.

Using our equation took 10 microseconds for a ridiculously larger number, which is 10 millionth of a second. I ran these on my first gen MacBook Pro Retina.

## Playing around with Swift and JavaScript

Again, no surprises here, but I was curious.

{% highlight javascript %}
function diff(n) {
  var sumOfSquares = squareOfSum = 0;

  while(n) {
    sumOfSquares += n * n, squareOfSum += n, n--;
  }

  squareOfSum *= squareOfSum;
  return squareOfSum - sumOfSquares;
}
{% endhighlight %}

On my computer, using map and reduce fills up the stack and throws an exception at $$n \sim 130000$$, while using a loop solves up to $$n = 10^9$$ in circa 3.5 seconds.

Swift didn't fair much better.

{% highlight swift %}
func diff(n: Int) -> Int {
    let array = [Int](1...n)

    let sumOfSquares = array.map({ $0 * $0 }).reduce(0, +)
    let sum = array.reduce(0, +)
    let squareOfSum = sum * sum

    return squareOfSum - sumOfSquares
}
{% endhighlight %}

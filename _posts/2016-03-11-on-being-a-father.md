title: On Being a Father
---

A lot of people ask me if being a parent is hard, and they're often surprised that my answer is no. It is hard if you have a sick child, you are raising a family in a war-torn place, or you have some extraordinary circumstances. But for those of us privileged to live in relative peace and prosperity, I think it's easy.

Since Sami was born I sleep little and wake early. I spend my mornings preparing breakfast, packing his bag, dressing him, and then driving him to school. In the evening, I'll bathe him, make his milk, and put him to sleep. I deal with temper tantrums frequently. I worry about his safety, but often because of something imaginary or hypothetical that borders on the ridiculous. But none of those things is hard. In fact, I am lucky and grateful that my worries are so mundane.

In contrast, I think of parents raising children in war. They worry whether they will have food, or they'll starve. They worry whether today is the one their home is blown away. Where will they find shelter and water? What do they do on cold nights? Forget breakfast, school, toys, and playtime. For those have no place where one needs to survive from one day to the next.

I can't in good conscience think that my life as a parent is hard compared to them.

Coming to terms with my emotions is what I find hard about being a father. I'm more emotional, and prone to self-doubt. I have an irrational fear that something might happen to Sami. I'm suddenly afraid of death when I've hardly thought about something so morbid in the past.

But there are far more positive things. Having a child is like getting to know a new person, only one I am destined to fall in love with, and for whom I set all my prejudices aside. I'm more patient and empathetic. I exercise better judgement and prefer to think things through over being cavalier. Heck, I'm even a better cook. To me, being a father is the greatest incentive for self-improvement.

Being a father isn't easy, and it requires an immense amount of energy and dedication. But it's fun, exciting, and rewarding. And if you can come to terms with your personal transformation, it isn't that hard.

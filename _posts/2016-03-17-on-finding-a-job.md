title: On Finding a Job
---

Last month at Aerogami we ran out of money and decided to halt development of new features on our product, Nimbus Workspaces. Instead, we decide to continue to fix bugs and provide support. It's not the end of the world, and we aren't giving up. But we need money to live, and for me, it means it's time to put my entrepreneurship ambitions aside and look for a job.

After years of independence, this is a scary thought.

But still, I don't mind giving that up as long as I find a project I admire and believe in. After all, I wanted independence because I wanted to build things I believed made a difference to people. There's no reason I can't do that elsewhere. And back then I didn't need the money; today I have two children. If giving up being an entrepreneur is better for them, then I'm happy to make that sacrifice.

So I came to terms with my decision and enthusiastically started my job search.

I found a few startups and read some of their blogs. I looked at the kind of work they do--and how brilliant their engineers are--and BOOM! It hit me. My confidence dived, and self-doubt crept in. These engineers are doing some great stuff! I started to question whether I am worthy to join those companies.

To ease away my fears, I went to a few coding-challenge websites and nervously tried to solve problems, looking for ways to reassure myself that I am smart and capable.

Before I knew it I had invested my day in trying to solve the Travelling Salesman and other abstract computer science problems that made my head hurt.

And then I stopped.

I'm a product guy, a developer. I get things done. I'm curious, and I work extremely hard. I learn from the challenges I overcome. I'm empathetic and I care deeply about people.

If my skills were an impression on clay, it would take the shape of every problem I solved in every product I built. And this shape would resemble more of a Frankenstein than orderly symmetry.

I didn't study computer science or have to solve theoretical problems. My bread-and-hummus is building a user experience, writing models, and wiring them up with controllers, then keeping things orderly with service objects, and so on.

The solution to the Travelling Salesman problem wouldn't have helped me build Gamezilla or Inkk.

When I wrote Bol√£o Social, the most complex algorithm I wrote calculates World Cup tables from a set of predictions and accounts for edge cases and tie-breakers. I didn't need to know how to encode a binary tree into an array. But I needed to know how to design a good user experience; how to update the scores of thousands of players with no downtime. I needed to know architecture, the big picture. I spent my time learning to use disparate technologies in harmony to create and ship a beautiful, fun, working product.

Frankenstein can write and ship quality code, after all.

My point is, it's OK not to know this stuff for now. Right now my priority is to send my CV to potential employers, and not solve abstract computer science problems. Last year, my priority was to build great features for Nimbus Workspaces, and not solve the Dinning Philosophers.

That doesn't mean I don't want to study fundamental computer science concepts. Of course, I do. But I haven't needed to solve abstract, and often mathematical problems in my day-to-day work. Most of the time I build CRUD applications and UX components. Creating a product is hard, and I have to spend my time solving real world problems.

If the need arises and these concepts become essential for my work, I'm more than happy to reach for the books. Meanwhile, I'll wait for an opportunity to study them without shunting my priorities aside.

So what does it all mean?

It means there are gaps in my knowledge, and I may not be suitable for many engineering jobs out there. And that's OK because no one is suitable for every role in our industry. Nor should they be. My target pool is smaller, but when I find something it's likely to be a better fit, and I'll enjoy working there much more.

Whatever product I end up working on, my focus will be on the things that make it successful. Whether that's solving abstract computer science problems, or writing CRUD controllers.

Be lean and versatile. Take pride in your work, and don't feel bad about not being a genius. Hit the books as often as you can, but not at the expense of your priorities--unless your priorities necessitate that you hit the books. Reach for the stars, but don't forget that the moon is your first stop on the way.
